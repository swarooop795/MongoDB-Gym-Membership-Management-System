# MongoDB-Gym-Membership-Management-System

# 🧠 1. Core Technologies Used
Flask: Web framework to handle routing and views.

MongoDB (via PyMongo): Backend database to store member, subscription, and admin data.

Jinja2: Templating engine (used in HTML templates).

Werkzeug Security: Used for password hashing.

Bootstrap-like CSS + Font Awesome: For modern UI styling (written manually in templates).

# 🏗 2. Application Structure
# A. MongoDB Collections

members: Stores member personal info and subscription.

subscriptions: Stores plan options (Basic, Standard, Premium).

admin: Stores admin credentials and metadata.

# B. Routes (Flask App Endpoints)

/login	-> Admin login page
/	 -> Dashboard (view all members + expired)
/add_member  ->	Add a new gym member
/update_subscription/<member_id>	-> Update an existing subscription
/delete_member/<member_id> -> Delete a member
/delete_expired  -> Remove all expired memberships
/members_by_plan/<plan_id>	-> View members filtered by plan
/view_member/<member_id>	-> View a single member’s full info
/logout	 -> Admin logout
/print_member/<member_id> -> Generates a printable version (intended PDF)

# 🧾 3. Functions and Features Explained

# ✅ Security
Passwords are hashed using generate_password_hash.

Session secret key is generated using os.urandom(24) (should be constant in production).
